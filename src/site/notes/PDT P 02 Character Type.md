# Character Type

Characters are represented using 8 bits values.

For built-In functions on character type, seeÂ [[APX A 03 StdChar\|APX A 03 StdChar]] module for additional information.

## Character Type Declaration

Character type is explicitly declared with `Char`.

```Clean
// Language: Clean

expr :: Char
expr =  'a'
```

## Character Literals

They are constructed by placing a character inside a pair of single quotation marks (`'...'`).

```Clean
// Language: Clean

x :: Char
x =  '1'
x =  'a'
x =  'A'
x =  '+'
```
