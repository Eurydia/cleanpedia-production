## Implementing a Function

A simple function definition consists of one or more function implementations.

See [Implementing a Function](function/Implementing%20a%20Function.md).

## Indirectly Defining a Function

A group of special expressions exists as syntactic sugar.
They are compiled down to a function definition.
By invoking such an expression, a function is indirectly defined.

See [Special Expressions](Expressions/Special%20Expressions.md).

## Infix Operators

Operators are arity-two functions.
They behave and follow similar rules to that of ordinary arity-two functions.
The main difference is that operators can be called between its arguments.

See [Defining an Operator](operator/Defining%20an%20Operator.md).

## Typing a Function

A function definition can be explicitly typed to increase readability.

See [Typing a Function](function/Typing%20a%20Function.md)
