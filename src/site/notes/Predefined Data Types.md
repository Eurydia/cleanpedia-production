# Predefined Data Types

Predefined data types are introduced for reasons of efficiency and convenience.
They serve as syntactic sugar to algebraic types.

For additional clarity, predefined data types include:
- [[Predefined Data Types/Primitive Data Types (Index)\|Primitive Data Types (Index)]], and
- [[Predefined Data Types/Structured Data Types (Index)\|Structured Data Types (Index)]]
