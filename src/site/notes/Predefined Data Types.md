# Predefined Data Types

Predefined data types are introduced for reasons of efficiency and convenience.
They serve as syntactic sugar to algebraic types.

For additional clarity, predefined data types are categorized into two groups.

Predefined primitive data types include:
- [[Predefined Data Types/Integer Type\|Integer Type]],
- [[Predefined Data Types/Real Number Type\|Real Number Type]],
- [[Predefined Data Types/Character Type\|Character Type]], and
- [[Predefined Data Types/Boolean Type\|Boolean Type]]

Predefined structured data types include:
- [[Predefined Data Types/List\|List]],
- [[Predefined Data Types/Tuple\|Tuple]], 
- [[Predefined Data Types/Array\|Array]], and
- [[Predefined Data Types/Arrow Type\|Arrow Type]].
