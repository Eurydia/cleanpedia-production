## Introduction

The motivation of this reference is to create an accessible, concise, and clear documentation for those who are seeking to learn CLEAN.

The same information can be found on:

- [Cloogle](https://cloogle.org/) which is the languageâ€™s search engine, and
- [language report](https://cloogle.org/doc/) which describes the syntax and BNF of Clean.

However, this documentation is not official.
Terminologies and explanations may not be entirely true to the references used.

In addition, the language report, which was the primary source of this documentation, was written for the version 2.0 of CLEAN.
