# Predefined Data Types

Predefined data types are introduced for reasons of efficiency and convenience.
They serve as syntactic sugar to algebraic types.

For additional clarity, predefined data types are categorized into two groups.
They are:
- [[_content/Predefined Data Types/Primitive Data Types\|Primitive Data Types]]
- [[_content/Predefined Data Types/Structured Data Types\|Structured Data Types]]
