# Boolean Type

Booleans are represented using 8 bits values.

For built-in functions on Boolean type, see [[Appendix A/StdBool\|StdBool]] moduleÂ for additional information.

## Boolean Type Declaration

Boolean type is explicitly declared with `Bool`.

```Clean
// Language: Clean

expr :: Bool
expr =  1 == 1
```

## Boolean Literals

Boolean literals have two constructors.

```Clean
// Language: Clean

x :: Bool
x =  True
x =  False
```

## Using Integer Literal as Pattern

```Clean
// Language: Clean

implies :: Bool Bool  -> Bool
implies    True False =  False
implies    _    _     =  True
```
